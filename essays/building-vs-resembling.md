<h1>Building vs. Resembling</h1> 

<h2>It started as a dream!</h2>

<p>Back in the day when I thought that HTML is the only language I need to learn to build the web. The more you study, the more you know that what you know is so little. In 1998, I saw the first computer in my life. From that day, I fell in love with it. I remembered it was running Windows 10. Oops! It ran windows 98 and used the phone line to connect to the internet. That is my dream began. I was self-learning how to make websites but not make something beautiful. I finally found myself giving up to make an excellent site since it takes so much time to deal with CSS classes. </p>

<h2>I am not giving up!</h2>

<p>I was so excited when I know that studying ICS 314 class has some involvement with websites. So I will do it for real this time. Yes, I was surprised about Javascript, but UI Frameworks make me more exciting. Since I can you something "for real." HTML and CSS were disappointed me one time, but UI Frameworks is not. I do not need to create things from scratch. It would demand a significantly longer time to build web applications using raw HTML and CSS. Frameworks such as Twitter Bootstrap and Semantic UI have made our life more comfortable. They provide programmers to produce responsive websites without redesigning the components. It gives the programmer with the tools to immediately view results in development.</p>

<h2>UI Frameworks is the "cooler" way to build the websites!</h2>

<p>It is possible to write one single HTML file to build a beautiful website with UI Frameworks. I think they are a set of premaking CSS classes, but they are so easy to use. It is like you writing English. Example, the size will be small, medium, and large, not pixel, percentages. That's great for me. I can quickly modify the theme with a much short length of the code. It just appears in my head that it is like a multiple-tool.</p>
