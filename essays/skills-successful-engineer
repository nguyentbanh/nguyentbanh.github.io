There are many skills a person demands to become a successful engineer.  Engineering is changing, so it requires people who can communicate with others, and continuously adjust to new challenges. In my opinion, I need to focus on technical skills, communications skills, leadership skills, teamwork.

To do any job, you should learn all the necessary first. The technical skills are essential for an engineer. An engineering education only gives the basis of this knowledge. The technology is continuously developing. I need to continue to learn new technology. Communication is critical in the engineering career both in writing and verbally. Writing and public speaking are a must have classes to repair for this skill when I still in school. Communication is essential because I have to work in a team environment. When you want to build something big, we need a team, not a person. However, the team without the leadership skills can not go far and correct direction. Leadership may be not the team leader, but it is planning, set schedule, make choices. 

If I want to become a successful engineer, I donâ€™t need to focus on those skills. What I need is an ability to apply them when needed. It will take time and attention, but the joy is the result I get to succeeding the assignments and recognizing the meaning my work will contribute to the community.
