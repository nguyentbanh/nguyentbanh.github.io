Letâ€™s examine the topic: why specifically do we want coding standards and what advantages do they award? Coding standards are a list of style for a particular programming language that defines the programming style, methods, for many features of the program written in that language. There is a close connection between coding standards and software maintainability. A coding standard assures that all developers are communicating the code in a detailed single language guideline. This standard produces the easy to follow and uniformed code. One of the fundamental parts of a software system is the consistency of the coding standard because it undoubtedly affects the quality of the system. 

While it is entirely no doubt that source code that follows to proper standards is more understandable, coding standards have another view which is regularly ignored at the cost of too much concentration on the beauty of the coding. Efficient coding standards concentrate on procedures that highlight problems and cause bugs stand-out and apparent to everyone. Our class code standard has all of that function which is so awesome. After the first week of exercising ESLint with IntelliJ, I learned so much more than without using it. When practiced coding standards for the right purposes and in the proper way, contribute many advantages. 

I think some coding standards can assist you to learn a programming language. Without a coding standard, developers will use their systems for coding, and this has several adverse consequences. The principal causes for regularly exploited software vulnerabilities are inconsistencies, bugs, and errors in the logic. Most of these obstacles occur due to programming mistakes that happen from weak coding exercises. Lousy coding also influences the overall execution of the site. Many performance problems include User Interaction, Server Response, Code reusability, Flow issues.

Practicing code standards in this class is an excellent start for getting used to with the systems which are applying to many technology companies. Finished source code should follow a form as if a single developer wrote the code in one session. For a big company or small company, we usually have to work in a group, and consistent coding is essential. Following a consistent coding standard supports to enhance the condition of the overall software system. The solution to an excellent coding standard is consistency. This consistency must be found within the standard itself but also within the source code that uses the standard.
