My personal opinion after a couple days working with Javascript is a fantastic learning tool. I have studied some different programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. Before studying Javascript, I thought it should be a version of Java for web development. After studying a couple lessons about Javascript, I thought it seems like python language because of their likeness to pseudocode. Now, I feel like Javascript has a lot of differences with python. It has some features from python, Java and its' own favor. I think Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. Javascript seems like easier for understanding and more efficient. 

According to Professor Johson, Philip, athletic software engineering is " a high intensity, time-constrained, and often stress-inducing approach to acquiring competency with software engineering skills. " This a new educational technique for me. I am a little bit worried about that technique because it sounds it is not easy if you do not prepare well for Workouts of the Day (WODs). I am usually taking time for solving a problem but this WODs is different. It is good for practicing WODs because it makes me think faster. It is stressful but when you complete the problem on time, it motivates you to do more. This is new to me. I think I will have a little trouble with it. However, with a lot of practicing during the semester, I think I can get used to it.
