My personal opinion after a couple of days working with Javascript is that Javascript a fantastic learning tool. I have studied some different programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. Before studying Javascript, I thought it should be a version of Java for web development. After exploring a couple of lessons about Javascript, I thought it seems like python language because of their likeness to pseudocode. Now, I feel like Javascript has a lot of differences with python. It has some features from python, Java and its’ favor. I think Javascript is a functional programming language from a software engineering perspective. Javascript seems like more comfortable for understanding and more efficient. Besides Javascript my new programming language, I am also impressed with "athletic software engineering" which is introduced in ICS 314 class. 

According to Professor Johson, Philip, athletic software engineering is “ a high intensity, time-constrained, and often stress-inducing approach to acquiring competency with software engineering skills. “ This a new educational technique for me. I am a little bit worried about that technique because it sounds it is not easy if you do not prepare well for Workouts of the Day (WODs). I am usually taking time for solving a problem, but this WODs is different. It is useful for practicing WODs because it makes me think faster. It is stressful, but when you complete the problem on time, it motivates you to do more. This WODs is new to me. I think I will have a little trouble with it. However, with a lot of practicing during the semester, I think I can get used to it.

A new semester with a lot of promising things to learn is already started. I hope by the end of this semester, I can use Javascript and WODs method confidently.
