summary: A computer is an essential tool for most people nowadays, and therefore, need to have a better cyber defence. Cybersecurity is an area that is continuously active and expanding. Hackers are always seeking to discover different ways to infiltrate systems and connections. We successfully cracked WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption by using the script in Kali Linux operating system, while also performing Reverse Shell attacks to windows and linux. This lab gave active support and introduction for our future work. We plan to apply the skills we learned this semester to actual computer and network penetration testing. Even exploring broader devices like car, IoT and phone hacking.

Cybersecurity is an area that is continually growing. Hackers are always seeking to discover different ways to infiltrate systems and connections. Ethical Hacking also called as Penetration Testing is a performance of intruding into system or networks to discover out threats, vulnerabilities in those operations which a malicious intruder may locate and exploit generating the loss of data, financial loss or other significant damages.  The goal of ethical hacking is to enhance the security of the network or systems by establishing the vulnerabilities discovered during testing. 

Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing. Kali has over 600 different applications and cybersecurity testing tools pre-installed and ready to use

Our project based on three scenarios are physical access, wifi hacking and reverse shell.
