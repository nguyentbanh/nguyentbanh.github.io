From the search of shipwrecks to the remediation of disturbed underwater habitat and installation of instruments on the seafloor, individuals who possess entrepreneurial skills are in high demand and stand out in the crowd of potential job candidates. Entrepreneurial skills include the experience to understand the business processes, work as an integral part of a team, think critically and apply technical knowledge and skills in new and innovative ways. Individuals who develop a mindset for innovation and collaboration will be well prepared for the global workplaces. To help students understand better and develop these skills, the MATE ROV competition create the competition. Our first task is to create a company or organization that specializes in solutions to real-world marine technology problems.

A underwater robot was created by our team to participate in the Mate ROV Competition. Our robot has to be designed under limit of weight and size. The robot has to complete couple different tasks under the limited time. We also practice doing the project like a small company with everybody has different jobs and title. We did the technical document for almost everything. In this project I gained experience with Raspberry Pi, robot arm design, robot arm control, image recognition, machine learning,and leadership.
