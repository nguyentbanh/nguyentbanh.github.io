Our robot has to be designed under limit of weight and size. The robot has to complete couple different tasks under the limited time. 

We also practice doing the project like a small company with everybody has different jobs and title. We did the technical document for almost everything. 

In this project I gained experience with Raspberry Pi, robot arm design, robot arm control, image recognition, machine learning,and leadership.
